flesh palanquin

donnie darko/tamagotchi/katamari
collage build on player model
the walls of your room are both a window and a screen
lights and sirens shadows on the walls
adding to the screen collage that obscures your vision of the outside
the shadows of it falling on the wall
playing with scale at that moment before you fall asleep
ortho vs perspective

your own life:

timer on your screen, zach lieberman 1/3 art, teaching, commercial
body decaying, need to eat and exercise to do anything else
wake up, put on coffee, brush teeth, shower, leave home
